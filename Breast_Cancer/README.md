# Breast Cancer

In this project, we are predicting breast cancer recurrence, and want to find the best machine learning model for the task.

This assignment demonstrates several important machine learning principles. The data is carefully inspected, cleaned, and analyzed thoroughly before a model is even built. Mutiple models are tried out, because different models tend to perform better for different data sets, based on underlying patterns. For a simpler example, an exponential or logistic curve will better model population growth, while a linear regression will better model Hooke's Law. The models are then evaluated on independent data to determine the best choice.

## Contents

- [`bc.csv`](bc.csv): Initial data set.
- [`bc_clean.csv`](bc_clean.csv): Processed data set used to train machine learning models. See the notebooks and report for more details on methodology.
- [`breast_cancer.pdf`](breast_cancer.pdf): This report summarizes the assignment.
- [`part-1.ipynb`](part-1.ipynb): This part cleans and saves the data set. It also includes traditional analysis methods.
- [`part-2.ipynb`](part-2.ipynb): This part uses the data to train and test models.

## Setup and Execution

The `.ipynb` files can be run with Jupyter Notebook using a Python 3 kernel. The snippets themselves can also be run as a simple Python script, but the output stream will need to be printed or written to files appropriately.
