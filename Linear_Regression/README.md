# Linear Regression

In this project, we analyze a data set of cars from the 70’s and early 80’s. Our core question is *What impacts the fuel economy of automobiles?* We also seek to model it with machine learning. First the data is cleaned, before being analyzed and used to train a simple linear regression machine learning model. The model is found to represent the data fairly well, but imperfectly.

This assignment demonstrates several important machine learning principles. The data is carefully inspected, cleaned, and analyzed thoroughly before a model is even built. The model is then evaluated on independent data to determine its worthiness. The model and prior analysis combined inform the conclusions.

## Contents

- `part-1.ipynb`: This part downloads, cleans, and saves the data set. It also includes traditional analysis methods.
- `part-2.ipynb`: This part uses the data to train and test a linear regression model.
- `linear_regression.pdf`: This report summarizes the assignment.

## Setup and Execution

The `.ipynb` files can be run with Jupyter Notebook using a Python 3 kernel. The snippets themselves can also be run as a simple Python script, but the output stream will need to be printed or written to files appropriately.
