# Machine Learning

This repository contains assignments from COE 379L: Software Design for Responsive Intelligent Systems with Joe Stubbs ([Email](mailto:jstubbs@tacc.utexas.edu), [TACC](https://tacc.utexas.edu/about/staff-directory/joe-stubbs/), [GitHub](https://github.com/joestubbs)).

## What is this class?

Though the name is long, this was essentially an application-oriented machine learning course. We learned how to choose and develop machine learning models for realistic applications in the sciences. We were introduced to several common kinds of models, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, random forest, artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, large language models etc. Crucially, we investigated what kinds of problems these tools are best-equipped to solve. Additional topics included verification and validation, data filtering and cleaning, software development best practices.
